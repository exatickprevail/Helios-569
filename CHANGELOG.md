# Changelog

All notable changes to HELIOS, grouped by theme rather than strict
added / changed / fixed buckets. Entries below the top one are
preserved from the in-tree history that used to live inside
`ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## v1.8.2

> Hardening release on top of v1.8.1. The cycle focuses on three
> things: recorder relief for installs with high-frequency
> sensors (1 Hz Victron Cerbo, JK BMS, Ecowitt feeds and
> similar) so loading Helios no longer blocks every other card
> on the dashboard for 30 to 100 seconds on each mount, camera
> pose + lock persistence to localStorage so the framing
> survives page reloads, and a chip family harmonisation pass
> (cloud chip joins the canonical recipe, leader-bead radii
> unified, sun arc gets its own fullscreen ramp). The dashboard
> panel's today's battery totals are back to a full-day window
> after beta.4 over-trimmed them, and the back-to-live
> affordance is now a real tab anchored to the chart card.
>
> The full beta-by-beta narrative is preserved below. Upcoming
> work is tracked live on the public roadmap at
> [helios-lidar.org/roadmap](https://helios-lidar.org/roadmap),
> pulled directly from the GitHub Project and refreshed every
> five minutes.
>
> Special thanks to **LBDG_** and **JJAsond** for the relentless
> field testing on 1 Hz installs throughout the entire beta
> cycle. They turned the recorder pressure investigation from
> "intermittent, slow, weird" into a precise diagnosis (the
> grid module's 72 h raw window being the last hot path, the
> raw-window cap anchor mis-sourced from the forecast horizon,
> the LTS arm being over-capped in beta.4) and validated each
> beta in production before it shipped. v1.8.2 would not be
> where it is without their patience.

### beta.8

### Cloud chip joins the canonical chip family

The cloud-cover chip and its three layer sub-chips (low / mid /
high) read with a different visual recipe than the rest of the
chip family: 1 px divider-grey border vs the canonical 2 px
coloured ring used by PV, SoC, Grid In and Grid Out. The cloud
chip also lifted by 1 px on hover (translateY) which left the
top-anchored pill bouncing visually each time the cursor entered
or left it.

The cloud chip now uses the same compact pill recipe as PV / SoC
/ Grid: 2 px ring in the configured cloud colour
(`--helios-cloud-color`, falling back to the HA secondary text
token then `#727272`), `gap: 4px`, `min-width: 56px`, `padding:
3px 10px`, `ha-icon` sized at 16 px to match. The 22 px fixed
height is gone, the padding now drives the chip dimensions
exactly like the other chips.

The hover transform is gone. On hover the chip stays anchored at
its X-centred top spot and the box-shadow softens from
`0 1px 3px` to `0 2px 8px`; on active the shadow drops back
flat. The user explicitly asked for shadow-only feedback so the
chip does not move around.

The three layer sub-chips get the same 2 px coloured ring so the
detail view reads as a coherent group with the parent chip.

### beta.7

### Sun arc gets its own fullscreen ramp

beta.5 scaled both the sun arc radius and the home chip cluster
offsets through a single helper `_heliosScale()` that ramped
from 1.0 at min(width, height) <= 600 px to 1.6 at >= 1200 px.
The chip cluster looked right at that ramp, but the arc still
read as small on a fullscreen / kiosk canvas.

The arc is computed in world metres, projected by MapLibre at a
fixed zoom: at the standard 440 px-wide card 40 m maps to ~140
CSS px and fills the lower half of the canvas. On a 1500 px-wide
kiosk canvas the same 40 m still maps to ~140 px and gets lost
in the empty space. The chip cluster, which is computed directly
in pixel offsets, did NOT need the same multiplier.

A dedicated helper `_sunArcScale()` ramps the arc on its own from
1.0 at <= 600 px to 3.0 at >= 1200 px, applied at the two call
sites (`_sunSpherePoint` for the arc itself,
`_projectSpherePoint` for the shading-dome cells that share the
same celestial hemisphere).

The chip cluster ramp (`_heliosScale()`) stays at 1.6 max so the
home chips do not over-spread on a wide canvas.

### beta.6

### Battery dashboard panel today's totals, restore full-day integration

The dashboard panel (the dive-in view opened by clicking the
home) shows today's charged / discharged kWh totals for the
battery, computed by `computeBatteryToday` integrating the
signed power curve from `_batteryPowerHistory` between local
midnight and now.

beta.4 capped every history fetch at the last 6 hours to keep
the recorder responsive on 1 Hz installs. That cap applied to
BOTH arms of `fetchBatteryHistory`: the LTS arm
(`recorder/statistics_during_period`, 5-minute period) and the
raw fallback. The LTS arm is near-free on the recorder
regardless of source frequency, so capping it served no perf
purpose; what it cost was the morning portion of today's
battery curve, and the panel reported a fraction of the day's
true charged / discharged energy as a result.

`fetchBatteryHistory` now takes two start anchors:

- `ltsStart`: the full visible timeline range (typically midnight
  or earlier). The LTS arm queries the recorder over this
  broader window so today's totals integrate across the full
  current day.
- `rawStart`: the last 6 hours. The raw fallback (used only
  when the entity is not LTS-tracked) keeps its cap so a 1 Hz
  BMS without `state_class` does not drag the recorder.

PV, grid and W/m² were not affected: PV's chart blend already
falls through to the 5-day hourly LTS slot for past beyond 6 h,
grid's two-tier backfill (24 h LTS + 6 h raw) landed in beta.3,
W/m² is not surfaced on the dashboard panel.

### beta.5

### Uniform beads, fullscreen polish (#33)

**Leader-bead radii unified.** The animated discs that ride the
solid leaders between the home and its chips were sized
inconsistently across the family: `r=4` on PV and battery,
`r=3.5` on grid import / export, `r=5` on the solar ray. All five
classes now use `r=3` (6 px diameter), matching the visual weight
HA Energy gives to its own flow circles when rendered at the
typical card size.

**Fullscreen / kiosk layout polish (#33).** When the card is
rendered above 900 CSS px wide (a dedicated solar dashboard view,
a kiosk panel, mobile portrait on a tablet), the layout used to
keep the chip cluster clumped in the central 25 % of the canvas
and the sun arc pinned to its grid-tuned 40 m radius.

A new engine helper `_heliosScale()` ramps a multiplier from 1.0
at min(width, height) <= 600 px to 1.6 at >= 1200 px, fed by the
existing ResizeObserver-backed canvas dimension cache. The
multiplier scales:

- `SUN_ARC_RADIUS_M`: the celestial hemisphere the sun arc and
  the shading-dome paint on stretches with the card, so the arc
  reads from across the room.
- `PV_CHIP_OFFSET_PX`, `CHIP_SIDE_X_OFFSET_PX`, `CHIP_STACK_GAP_PX`,
  `CLUSTER_LIFT_PX`: the chip cluster around the home spreads
  proportionally, so the PV / battery / grid pills no longer
  collide in the centre.

At standard Lovelace grid sizes scale = 1.0 and the geometry
stays exactly as before.

CSS-side, a new `@container helios-card (min-width: 900px)` rule
bumps the typography on the value chips (PV / battery / grid /
cloud / solar), the day-strip, the hover tooltip and the cloud
layer chips so they stay readable at the same distance. The
container query targets the card's own width via
`container-type: inline-size` on `ha-card`, so a Helios card
sitting in a wide section view alongside narrower cards flips
on its own size, not the viewport's.

### beta.4

### Fix the beta.1 raw-window cap anchor, restores past chart history

beta.1 capped the PV, W/m² and battery raw fetches at the last
6 hours and computed the cap as `fetchEnd - 6 h`, where
`fetchEnd` was sourced from `host._timeRange.end` (the forecast
horizon, typically next day 23:59) rather than wall-clock time.
On any timeline where `end > now`, the resulting `fetchStart`
fell in the FUTURE.

Each `fetch*History` helper then ran its own "clamp end to now"
pass, and the resulting `start >= fetchEnd` condition tripped
the early-return that blanks the slot to `{times: [], values:
[]}`. The chart's past portion stayed empty and the curve only
started painting from the moment live state pushes began
landing (i.e. from the refresh instant forward).

The three sites (`refreshPv`, `refreshBattery`,
`refreshSolarRadiation`) now anchor the cap on `Date.now()`
directly, so `fetchStart` always sits 6 hours back from real
wall-clock time and the inner clamp leaves the slot populated.

### beta.3

### Grid LTS backfill, restores past-scrub coverage to 24 h

beta.2 capped the grid raw backfill at 6 h to unblock the
recorder on 1 Hz installs. The trade-off was that scrubbing the
home card timeline past 6 h returned no value on the grid
import / export chips (pickBracket refused to extrapolate
beyond the buffer edge). This release adds the missing piece
without re-introducing the recorder stall.

The grid backfill is now two-tiered, mirroring the recipe the PV
chart already uses:

- LTS at 5-minute period covers the 24 h..6 h slice
  (~216 buckets per entity). Pulled from HA's pre-aggregated
  `statistics_short_term` table, near-free on the recorder
  regardless of source frequency.
- Raw, full resolution + `significant_changes_only`, covers the
  6 h..now slice. Bounded at ~10 to 20 k rows per entity on a
  1 Hz meter, completes in 1 to 2 s.

Both arms fire in parallel through the existing module-level
WS semaphore (cap 2 in-flight). The LTS arm is wrapped in a
silent `.catch` so a custom sensor without `state_class` (no
LTS available) degrades to raw-only and the user-facing
behaviour stays as-is.

LTS samples land in the same `Sample[]` buffer as the raw
samples, so `pickBracket` works as-is. Cumulative-energy meters
anchor LTS samples at the bucket end (consecutive `state`
deltas attribute to the correct bucket); power-native meters
anchor at the bucket midpoint and use `mean` directly.

The buffer retention window also bumps from 6 h to 24 h so the
live accumulation does not trim off bracket-relevant history
mid-session.

### beta.2

### Grid history window 72 h -> 6 h, the last recorder hot path

beta.1 capped the PV, W/m² and battery raw fetches at 6 hours and
the user-visible 100-second IO stall shrank but did not go away.
A re-audit of every WebSocket recorder call on the card surfaced
the remaining offender: the grid module
(`src/card/grid.ts`) was still fetching a 72-hour raw window
per grid entity on every card load. On a Victron Cerbo or
similar setup at 1 Hz that's ~250 000 rows scanned per import
+ export + optional combined entity, dwarfing every other fetch
the card issues.

`GRID_HISTORY_WINDOW_MS` (and the matching in-memory
`GRID_SAMPLE_WINDOW_MS`) drop from 72 h to 6 h. The trade-off
accepted is that scrubbing the timeline beyond 6 hours past now
returns a flat extrapolated watt value (the bracket-pick hits
the buffer edge), instead of a true historical bracket. Live
chips, recent past chart and short-scrub tooltips stay
accurate.

Combined with beta.1's caps, every recorder-bound call the card
issues on load is now at most 6 hours of raw data per entity,
and the LTS slots (calibration, trainer) keep the
multi-day past covered for the chart and the tooltip. A reload
mid-fetch no longer piles a fresh 100-second query onto the
queue; each query completes in 1 to 2 seconds even on 1 Hz
installs, so 5 rapid reloads cost ~10 seconds of recorder time
instead of ~500.

### beta.1

### Recorder relief on 1 Hz installs, camera persistence, back-to-live tab, polish

Direct follow-up to the beta.0 regressions and the high-frequency
sensor story. The card now leans on the LTS slots it already
fetched for everything older than the last 6 hours, so a Victron
Cerbo, JK BMS or Ecowitt setup at 1 Hz no longer drags the HA
recorder for tens of seconds every time the card loads. Camera
pose actually persists this time, the back-to-live control is a
real tab, and a handful of polish items land alongside.

**Recorder relief on 1 Hz installs.** The raw `history_during_period`
fetch behind the PV chart, the W/m² entity and the battery banks
used to ask HA for the full visible timeline (multiple days). On
a sensor pushing one value per second that scan dragged the
single-threaded recorder for 30 to 100 seconds on every card
load, blocking every other card reading the same entities for
the duration. The user reported disk IO jumping from 20 % to
67 % on InfluxDB-backed setups.

Three pieces:

- The raw window is capped at the last 6 hours per fetch site
  (PV, radiation, battery). The recent past keeps full
  resolution for tooltip and chart-head accuracy.
- The PV chart blends in the hourly LTS slot
  (`_pvCalibStats`, 5 days) for the past that the 6-hour raw
  window does not cover. The LTS slot was already fetched for
  the calibration ratio, so this is a free reuse, no extra
  recorder hit.
- The hover tooltip's `pvValueAtTime` falls through the same
  way: raw within the 6-hour window, LTS outside, forecast
  beyond "now".

Net IO drops by orders of magnitude on 1 Hz installs without any
visible quality loss on the chart or the tooltip.

**Past PV chart visible again.** A 1 Hz sensor over 6 hours
produces ~21 600 raw samples. The resulting SVG `d` path string
overflows Safari and Firefox's path rasterisers (the path
silently renders nothing), so the past portion of the chart was
showing up empty even though the tooltip read the correct
values. `renderPvChart` now decimates to at most 1 500 points
via per-pixel min/max bucketing so the visible curve still
reflects peaks and troughs at heavy compression. Same fix
incidentally speeds up every layout pass on the timeline by
~10×.

**Camera pose actually persists (#166 follow-up).** The
beta.0 fix wrote the pose under the engine's expected keys but
HA's lovelace does NOT persist `config-changed` events emitted
from a live card, only from the editor preview. The lock chip
now writes directly to `localStorage` under the key
`helios:camera-pose:<lat>:<lon>`. The engine reads the same
key on init, falls back to the legacy YAML keys for older
installs, and finally to the hemisphere-aware default. Locking
the camera, dragging it, reloading: the same pose comes back.

**Back-to-live is a real tab now.** The previous round
shipped a rounded capsule that read as a deformed button. The
new control is a proper tab: rounded TOP corners only, flat
bottom that overlaps the chart card's top border by 1 px so
the tab looks physically attached. Side still flips based on
the scrub position (scrub on the right -> tab on the left, and
vice versa). The tab's pointerdown and click both
`stopPropagation()` so a tap on the tab no longer bubbles up
to the time-bar's scrub handler (which used to re-scrub to
the tab's X coordinate and silently swallow the click).

**Lock button stripped of tooltip + i18n.** The `title=`
attribute and the two i18n keys (`cameraLockEnable`,
`cameraLockDisable`) are gone. A tooltip on a touch device
never shows, and the padlock glyph already carries the
meaning. `aria-label` for accessibility is implicit via the
icon's HA semantics, no localised string is generated on the
critical render path.

**Home glow z-index lowered.** The hover glow + production
pulse used to paint over the home cluster chips (PV, battery,
grid import/export). z-index drops from 9 to 6 so the glow sits
above the basemap and the solar ray but below all chips at z 8.

**Solar incidence ray thinner.** The dashed sun -> PV connector
was at `stroke-width: 1.5`, thicker than the other solid
leaders (which dropped to 1 in #164). Now also at 1 so the
connector family reads at one weight.

### beta.0

### Chrome simplification, camera pose persistence, CSS audit pass

First beta of the v1.8.2 line. Closes the alpha cycle by tightening
the on-card chrome in preparation for the upcoming HA Energy
integration: fewer chips on screen, the camera pose actually
sticks across reloads, the editor surface area shrinks, and a CSS
audit pass aligns the styling on HA's design tokens so the card
flips polarity cleanly with the host theme.

**Camera pose + lock state are now persistent (#166).** The lock
chip introduced in alpha.13 wrote the bearing and pitch under
`camera-bearing` and `camera-pitch`. The engine, on init, reads
`camera-bearing-deg` and `camera-pitch-deg` (the legacy editor
keys). The mismatch silently dropped the saved pose on every page
reload. The lock click handler now writes the `-deg` keys, so
locking + reloading restores the exact bearing, pitch and lock
state.

**Top-left chrome simplified (#167).** The date / time chip and
its scrub-mode "back to live" button are gone. The date is
promoted to the scrub tooltip (which now shows date + time +
readings) and the tooltip pins itself at the scrub cursor when
the user is not actively hovering, so the moment selected on the
timeline stays labeled. The back-to-live button moves to a small
scrub-blue tab on the time-bar that swaps side based on the
scrub position: cursor in the right half, tab on the left;
cursor in the left half, tab on the right, the two never
collide.

**Overlay layout restored (#168).** The camera lock chip moves
to the top-left rail (replacing the deleted clock chip) and the
three view-mode toggles (default layer, LiDAR view, shading
dome) move back to the top-right rail. The middle-right rail
introduced in alpha.13 is gone.

**Timeline day-strip tightened for phone widths (#169).** The
day-strip cells at the bottom of the timeline still overflowed on
narrow phones. The font-size clamp drops from `clamp(6px, 6.5cqw,
9px)` to `clamp(6px, 5.5cqw, 8px)`, the inline gap between the
date and the kWh value drops to 1 px, the cell padding to 1 px,
the `·` separator margin to 2 px, and the letter-spacing to 0.
The hierarchy (bold date, lighter italic forecast kWh) is
unchanged.

**Display radius locked at 300 m (#170).** Past 300 m the
basemap + LiDAR fetch and the per-frame projection start to
chug on mid-range phones, and the home cluster stops reading as
"near home" anyway. The editor slider is removed, the engine
returns the constant directly, and the two i18n keys
(`displayRadius` + `displayRadiusHint`) are dropped from every
locale.

**CSS audit pass.** A pass on the stylesheet against HA's design
tokens:

- Dead CSS removed: the `.lidar-view-toggle-btn` / `.lidar-view-chip`
  family is gone (the LiDAR toggle has been part of the
  `.mode-bar` radio group for several releases). Its dark-theme
  override is gone too.
- Token rename: `--text-primary-color` was a typo for
  `--text-on-primary-color`. Every consumer (`.mode-bar-seg.is-on`,
  `.camera-lock-btn.is-on`, `.tb-back-to-live`) now uses the
  correct token. The `#ffffff` fallback masked the typo so the
  visual output is unchanged.
- Hard-coded dark plate (`#191a1b` / `#e6e6e6`) on
  `.detail-close-btn`, `.dash-card` and the four bead strokes
  (`.pv-home-leader-bead`, `.battery-leader-bead`,
  `.solar-svg .solar-ray-bead`, `.dash-today-chart-hover-dot`)
  routed through `var(--card-background-color)` /
  `var(--primary-text-color)` / `var(--divider-color)` with the
  original hex as fallback.
- Missing fallbacks added on every `var(--primary-color)`,
  `var(--dark-primary-color)`, `var(--darker-primary-color)`
  occurrence so a theme that does not define the token (some
  community themes ship only the light grays) still gets the
  HA brand-blue palette.

### alpha.13

### Camera lock on the live card, hairline leaders, instant cloud-toggle

Three UI changes shipped together, each tracked in a dedicated
issue.

**Camera lock button on the permanent card UI (#163).** The
camera rotation X / Y sliders + lock switch are removed from the
editor "Camera" section (and the i18n keys that drove them are
gone with them). The same intent now lives directly on the live
card as a single lock chip pinned top-right: open padlock when
the camera is free, closed padlock when the pose is held.
Clicking the chip captures the bearing and pitch that the user
just dragged to, flips the lock state, persists the three values
to YAML through a normal `config-changed` event, and applies the
new lock to the live MapLibre instance in the same frame so the
button feel matches the visible map. Reload re-applies the saved
pose, since the values landed in YAML. The three view-mode
toggles (default layer, LiDAR view, shading dome) keep the same
X coordinate but move from the top-right rail to a new
middle-right rail, leaving the corner free for the lock chip.

**Hairline leader strokes (#164).** All six solid leader lines
on the home cluster move from `stroke-width: 2` down to
`stroke-width: 1` to match the connector lines on the Home
Assistant Energy dashboard. The card now reads as part of the
same Energy visual family when dropped on the same dashboard
view. The chart curves are untouched, their widths are tuned for
chart legibility rather than leader weight.

- `.pv-home-leader-line`
- `.battery-leader-line`
- `.grid-import-leader-line`
- `.grid-export-leader-line`
- `.home-drop-leader-line`
- `.cloud-layer-leader`

**Instant cloud-cover toggle (#165).** Tapping the central cloud
percentage chip used to expand the three layer chips (low / mid
/ high) and their L-shape leaders through a ~0.6 s cascade. The
cascade is removed entirely: the three chips and their leaders
appear and disappear in the same frame as the click. The
`transition` + every `transition-delay` rule on
`.cloud-layer-chips` and `.cloud-layer-leaders` are dropped, the
elements simply flip between `opacity: 0` and `opacity: 1`.

### alpha.12

### Pool reverted, shared fetch caches added

A deeper investigation into the Home Assistant frontend source
(see issue #162) confirmed that `hui-card.ts:195` hard-codes the
helios-card rebuild on every editor preview commit, with no
opt-out hook available. Cross-shadow-root DOM transplant of the
MapLibre container reliably broke rendering (basemap turned
black, timeline / solar arc overlays vanished), because the
moved node loses its old shadow root's CSS scoping AND lands in
a freshly-mounted parent whose layout has not yet resolved a
non-zero height, hitting the standard "container at 0 px causes
black canvas" failure mode.

Alphas 8 through 11 attempted to keep the engine alive across
the rebuild cycle and all introduced visible side effects.
Reverting to the simple lifecycle: every helios-card instance
owns its engine, creates it on mount, destroys it on disconnect.
The editor preview pane re-allocates a WebGL context per
config-changed commit, which is exactly what apexcharts-card,
mini-graph-card and Mushroom accept too. The live dashboard
tile is untouched, `hui-card` takes the `_updateElement` branch
when `preview === false` and the engine survives every
config-changed commit.

To make the per-commit recreation cheap, the parsed fetch
payloads are now cached at module scope:

- **Buildings**: the OpenMapTiles GeoJSON for the home is
  cached for 30 minutes per (homeLat, homeLon, radius,
  clusterRadius). A fresh engine after a slider commit picks up
  the cached payload synchronously and skips the network +
  parse round-trip.
- **LiDAR raster and shadow features**: same 30-min cache per
  (homeLat, homeLon, radius, rasterSize, providerId). The
  multi-megabyte typed array decode that the IGN COG provider
  performs is now paid once per session, not once per commit.

OpenFreeMap basemap tiles are already cached by the browser's
HTTP cache. The MapLibre `setStyle` re-fetch on a fresh engine
resolves from disk, not from network.

Removed: the engine pool, the DOM reparent helpers
(`HeliosEngine.reparentInto`, `HeliosEngine.getMapContainer`),
the engine pool API on `init.ts`
(`registerEngineInPool` / `claimEngineFromPool` /
`releaseEngineFromPool`). The `preview` field on `InitHost`.

### alpha.11

### Engine pool with eager registration and ownership handshake, fixes the per-commit WebGL respawn for real

The previous attempts failed because they registered the engine
into the pool from `disconnectedCallback`. The Home Assistant
frontend source (`hui-card.ts:121-166`, dev branch) confirms HA
constructs the new helios-card element, calls `setConfig` on it,
and only THEN removes the old element. By the time the OLD card's
`disconnectedCallback` fires, the NEW card has already been
constructed and is about to run its own `updated()`. The pool
push was always too late.

Alpha.11 inverts the timing.

- Eager registration: every engine pushes itself into the pool the
  moment it is created in `initEngineNow`, not at disconnect.
  When the slider commit destroys the preview pane, the NEW
  helios-card construction finds the OLD preview's engine already
  waiting in the pool.

- Pool key: (homeKey, mode) where mode is `preview` when HA
  sets `element.preview = true` (which the editor preview pane
  does, line `hui-card.ts:136-138`) and `live` for the dashboard
  tile. The preview pane never claims the live dashboard's
  engine, and vice versa.

- Owner handshake: each pool entry tracks `lastOwner`. Claim
  reassigns the owner and cancels any pending dispose. Release
  is a no-op when the releaser is not the registered owner (the
  old card releasing after a new card has already claimed). When
  the releaser IS the owner (real navigation away), release
  schedules dispose after the grace window.

The previous `pushEngineToPool` / `tryClaimPooledEngine` helpers
are replaced by `registerEngineInPool` /
`claimEngineFromPool` / `releaseEngineFromPool` /
`isCurrentPoolOwner`. The 1.5 second grace window is widened to
2.5 seconds to absorb the 1 second mount-debounce a fresh card
incurs before its first engine pass.

### alpha.10

### Pool transplant moves the container, not its children, basemap stops going black

Diagnostic on alpha.9 confirmed the pool itself works (the slider
drag stopped incrementing `enginesCreated`). The visible artefact
that remained was the basemap turning black when entering edit
mode, the engine pool was successfully grafting the previous
MapLibre stack into the editor preview pane but the transplant
broke MapLibre's rendering.

The alpha.9 transplant moved every CHILD of the old container into
a freshly-rendered new container, then poked MapLibre's private
`_container` field so future `appendChild` calls would land on the
new node. The trouble is that the new container started life at
0x0 dimensions in the new shadow root, `map.resize()` baked that
into the canvas, the basemap requested its tiles at the wrong
viewport, and the result was a black square (see also the project
memory rule "Black-map = check container height FIRST").

Alpha.10 instead moves the WHOLE old container DOM node into the
new shadow root, replacing the freshly-rendered empty
`<div id="map-container">` wholesale. MapLibre's `_container`
reference stays valid because we never reach into the private
field. The moved container keeps its existing children, its CSS
class names and its ResizeObserver wiring. A `requestAnimationFrame`
follow-up resize handles the typically-identical new dimensions
once the new shadow root completes its first layout pass.

### alpha.9

### Engine pool with MapLibre transplant, real fix for the per-commit WebGL respawn

Alpha.8 deferred the engine cleanup on `disconnectedCallback` and
cancelled it on the subsequent `connectedCallback`. The diagnostic
in #162 confirmed Home Assistant actually destroys the helios-card
element on every editor `config-changed` event and constructs a
fresh one. A new element instance never sees the old timer, so the
fix from alpha.8 covered only the same-instance reattach case
(rare in practice).

Replaces alpha.8's same-instance soft cleanup with a module-level
engine pool keyed by home coordinates. On disconnect the engine is
pushed to the pool, the next mount tries to claim it. When the
claim succeeds, `HeliosEngine.transplantToContainer(newContainer)`
moves the MapLibre stack (canvas, overlay divs, marker root) from
the orphaned container into the new shadow root's
`<div id="map-container">`, updates the MapLibre map's internal
container reference, and calls `map.resize()` so dimensions
follow. The new helios-card instance walks `wireEngineCallbacks`
to re-bind the engine to itself. No `new HeliosEngine(...)`, no
fresh WebGL context, no buildings refetch, no basemap reload.

The pool entry's cleanup timer destroys the engine after a 1.5 s
grace if no remount claims it (real navigation away). FIFO array
per home key supports multiple cards at the same coordinates.

### alpha.8

### Soft cleanup on disconnect, stops the per-commit WebGL respawn

Diagnosed via the in-card `window.heliosStats()` counters
(#162). Home Assistant detaches and re-attaches the same
helios-card custom-element instance on every `config-changed`
event emitted by the editor, slider commits and toggle flips
included, not only on the documented edit-mode entry. Each
detach was tearing the engine down and the immediate re-attach
was creating a fresh one, burning one full WebGL context
allocation per user input. With two cards on the dashboard the
counter incremented by 2 on every slider release.

`disconnectedCallback` now defers the engine cleanup by a
1 second grace instead of firing it immediately.
`connectedCallback` cancels the deferred cleanup if the same
element re-attaches within the grace, the engine, its MapLibre
stack and its WebGL context remain alive, and `updated()`
short-circuits the respawn branch because `_engine` is still
defined and `_lastHomeKey` still matches. If the grace expires
without a re-attach (real navigation away) the cleanup fires
exactly as before. Net result: zero WebGL context recreation on
slider drags, picker writes, toggle flips and the other editor
events that previously triggered a respawn cycle.

### alpha.7

### Resilience pass + hygiene cleanup

Block B (preventive resilience fixes) and block C (hygiene) batched
in one alpha.

Resilience:

- Open-Meteo rate-limit (HTTP 429) is no longer swallowed silently
  inside the weather fetch. The error now propagates with its
  status code so the engine catch arms the exponential back-off
  table instead of letting the card keep hammering Open-Meteo at
  the normal cadence under a rate-limit.
- `VISUAL_CONFIG_KEYS` extended to every key the engine actually
  consumes (PV layout, grid wiring, battery banks, inverter cutoff,
  timeline preferences, shadows, LiDAR precision). Live edits in
  the visual editor now reach the engine immediately instead of
  waiting for the next natural respawn (page reload, theme flip).
- Grid history backfill latch tracks a per-entity wall-clock and
  re-issues the 72 h fetch on a 24 h cadence so the buffer head
  stays fresh on long-uptime sessions. A `WsTimeoutError` arms a
  2 min cooldown so the next `refreshGrid` tick does not hammer
  the recorder with retries.
- Radiation statistics parser is strict on the `mean` column and
  no longer falls back to `state`. Pushing a cumulative MJ/m²
  counter through the engine would feed monotonically increasing
  values that look like 10000+ W/m² and distort every downstream
  derivation. Out-of-shape entities now degrade cleanly to the
  raw-history fallback.

Hygiene cleanups (no user-facing behaviour change):

- Removed the user-facing `v1.6.2` legacy-path reference from the
  `pvArrayPeakKwpHelp` editor hint in all 11 locales.
- Removed inline `1.8.0` / `alpha.18` version references from
  source comments. Comments now describe current state only.
- Corrected the `auto-rotate-enabled` schema default from `true`
  to `false` in both the schema doc comment and the README.
- Deleted the `HeliosColorPicker` custom element and its style
  block. The pre-1.8.0 editor color pickers are gone; the class
  was dead code in the bundle (~3-4 KB minified) and registered a
  globally-scoped custom element with no consumers. Bundle drops
  by 12 KB raw / 3 KB gzipped.
- Deleted 9 dead i18n keys from `i18n/index.ts` and all 11
  locales: `pvArrayShare`, `pvArrayShareHelp`, `gridSourceTitle`,
  `uiColorsHint`, `sunColor`, `cloudColor`, `pvColor`,
  `batteryColor`, `buildingColor`. Each was declared in the
  `Translations` interface and provided in every locale but never
  read anywhere in the source.
- Updated the README colour defaults (`sun-color`, `cloud-color`,
  `pv-color`, `battery-color`) to match the runtime constants.
  The previous palette values (`#EF9F27`, `#5A8DC4`, `#27B36B`,
  `#FF5252`) had been retired but the doc was not updated.
- Removed em-dashes from `.github/workflows/test.yml` (`—` would
  surface in CI failure logs).
- Dropped the hardcoded `open` attribute on the Timeline
  sub-section inside the editor UI accordion so it follows the
  same collapse contract as every other section.
- Added a NaN guard in `formatLocalisedNumber` so cold-cache or
  upstream parse failures render a neutral zero placeholder
  instead of surfacing the literal "NaN" string in chips.

### alpha.6

### Multi-fix on top of the recorder unblock series

A comprehensive audit on top of the alpha.2 to alpha.5 perf
migration surfaced seven issues that this release fixes in one
batch.

- The editor "Reset data cache" button now actually resets. The
  per-instance state was already cleared, but the cross-mount
  module caches added since alpha.3 kept the previous data alive,
  so the button looked broken. The reset now wipes PV, battery,
  radiation, and grid module caches in addition to the
  per-instance state.

- Chip values at scrub time stay populated across a wider range.
  The PV chip cursor reader used to fall back to the trainer
  stats slot only (30 days, but idle-deferred so it lands a beat
  after mount). It now consults the calibration stats slot first
  (5 days, fetched immediately), so a user who scrubs right
  after the page loads sees historical chip values without
  waiting on the idle queue.

- PV statistics fetch asks for both `mean` and `state` columns
  instead of an exclusive heuristic driven by the entity unit.
  Power sensors land via `mean`, cumulative-energy sensors land
  via `state`, the parser prefers whichever is populated.
  Removes a class of silent failures where the entity unit had
  not yet propagated to the card state at the time of the first
  fetch and a cumulative entity returned all-null `mean` buckets,
  leaving the slot empty and the calibration affiné value
  disappearing for the user.

- Calibration cross-day cumulative bucket no longer dropped.
  On hourly stats with bucket-midpoint anchor, the slice
  straddling midnight (23:30 of day D to 00:30 of day D+1) used
  to fail both day D's bucket guard and day D+1's previous-sample
  guard, losing one hour of cumulative energy per calibration
  day. The guard now tolerates the cross-day slice.

- Per-day kWh chips on the timeline no longer read 0 kWh for
  days beyond the narrow raw window. `computeDailyKwhTotals`
  now integrates `_pvCalibStats` (5 days hourly) for days the
  raw slot does not reach, while staying on the raw slot for
  the days it covers. The "3 days ago" chips now reflect what
  was actually produced instead of silently rounding to zero.

- Shading-map trainer no longer trains buckets that fall
  outside the battery SoC coverage when the inverter-cutoff
  guard is armed. The SoC histories piggyback on the raw PV
  fetch and only cover ~2 days; the trainer walks back 30
  days. For the 28-day gap, the cutoff guard used to fall
  through silently, accumulating phantom shadows at sun bins
  where the inverter was actually clamping batteries-full
  output. When the guard is configured and any SoC entity is
  wired, an out-of-coverage bucket now skips (advances the
  watermark) instead of training blind.

- Live tail of `_pvHistory` no longer reallocates on every
  tick. Pushing the live sample used to spread the entire
  arrays into fresh ones at up to 50 Hz, growing unbounded over
  long-uptime sessions. Push is now in-place and the tail
  trims entries that age out of `_timeRange.start` so the
  array stays bounded to the visible window.

### alpha.5

### Chip scrub coverage on cumulative-energy entities and outside-raw scrubs

Field follow-up on alpha.3 / alpha.4. The recorder freeze fix from
alpha.2 (#155) carried two latent regressions for users scrubbing
the timeline cursor:

- The PV chip resolver (`pvRateAtTime`) read `_pvHistory` only.
  Since the raw history slot is bounded to the chart's visible
  past (~2 days) the chip turned blank as soon as the cursor
  landed outside that window. The 5-min trainer-grade statistics
  slot covering the past 30 days is now consulted as a fallback,
  so scrub-time chip values resolve anywhere within the
  recorder's long-term-statistics retention (#161).
- The battery and radiation statistics fetches requested only
  the `mean` column. For entities with `state_class:
  total_increasing` (a cumulative kWh counter wired as battery
  power, an irradiance source surfaced as a Wh meter, etc.)
  `mean` is null per bucket and the parser dropped every row,
  even though HA returned non-empty arrays. Both fetches now
  request `['mean', 'state']` and the parser prefers the
  populated one. Slots land populated regardless of the source
  entity's class.

### alpha.4

### LiDAR polish + grid chip icons

- LiDAR mode-bar (#152): when the shadow fetch finishes loading,
  the satellite (or harddisk) glyph that replaces the spinner no
  longer inherits a frame of rotation animation. The
  `is-spinning` class now lives on the `ha-icon` itself so the
  animation drops in the exact frame the icon attribute swaps.
- LiDAR opacity slider (#153): the percent readout next to the
  slider thumb now tracks the drag. `_lidarViewOpacity` is
  intentionally not a Lit `@state` (the slider fires up to
  50 input events / s and a state coupling would re-render the
  entire card on every tick), so the readout span gets an
  imperative DOM write inside the input handler.
- Grid import / export chip icons (#154): from a home-centric
  reading, the previous icons pointed in the wrong direction.
  Swapped so the chip glyph matches its label.

### alpha.3

### Battery, radiation, semaphore: extending the alpha.2 recorder fix

Follow-up to alpha.2 after field validation against a Victron
Cerbo GX setup. The PV-path fix from alpha.2 worked (adaptive
calibration applied, recorder no longer globally frozen), but
two symptoms remained: battery data took several minutes to
populate, and each card mount caused a brief lag. A related
report described every apex-charts card on the same dashboard
flatlining while Helios was loading, the signature of Helios
still monopolising the recorder on cards that share the
connection.

- Battery and radiation fetches now follow the same statistics-
  first pattern as PV (#159). 5-minute buckets, ~576 rows per
  entity for a 2-day window vs ~150-200k raw on a 1 Hz BMS.
  Raw history fallback for entities without long-term statistics
  tracking. Module-level cache mirroring the PV pattern, no
  more refetch on every card mount.
- Global concurrency semaphore on the WebSocket fetch path
  (#160). Caps Helios's in-flight history / statistics fetches
  at 2, so the recorder retains headroom for other history-bound
  cards on the same dashboard.
- The 30-day shading-map trainer fetch defers behind the
  user-facing PV history and calibration fetches via
  `requestIdleCallback` (1 s timeout fallback). The chip and
  chart paint first, the trainer catches up in the background.

### alpha.2

### Recorder unblock on high-frequency PV sensors

- Tracked as #155. On installs whose PV entity reports more than
  one sample per second (e.g. a Victron Cerbo GX MPPT), the
  Helios card never finished loading and the HA recorder went
  unresponsive for unrelated entities while the card was open.
  Root cause was a single 30-day raw history fetch that ballooned
  to millions of state rows on high-frequency installs.
- The PV calibration and the 30-day shading-map trainer now
  consume `recorder/statistics_during_period` instead of raw
  history. ~120 hourly rows for the 5-day calibration, ~8.6k
  5-min rows for the 30-day trainer, vs potentially millions on
  the legacy path. Both consumers fall back to the raw window
  when the source entity is not long-term-statistics tracked
  (no `state_class`).
- Raw history fetches on the PV / grid / battery / radiation
  paths are now bound to the chart's visible window (~2 days)
  and pass `significant_changes_only: true` so HA drops
  bucket-internal duplicates server-side. Roughly 30 to 70 %
  fewer rows on noisy sensors.
- Module-level cache for the three PV slots survives the user
  navigating away from the Helios card and back (the previous
  per-LitElement cache reset on every mount). 15-minute TTL.
- WebSocket calls now have a 30-second timeout. On a stalled
  recorder the card degrades to live chip values rather than
  hanging on a loading state forever.

### alpha.1

- Editor polish: 16 px bottom margin on the Camera block so it
  no longer kisses the pixel-ratio segmented toggle below, and a
  12 px bottom margin on every `grid-source-row` so the combined
  entity picker (and the import / export pickers next to it) get
  air before the invert toggle / "add source" row underneath.
- Combined grid entity hint: dropped the inline brand list
  (Fronius P_Grid, Shelly EM, P1 net power, ...) from all 11
  locales; the YAML config doc carries the example list, the
  in-editor hint stays focused on what the field expects.

### alpha.0

### Camera pose control

New UI section in the editor for pinning the resting camera pose
and / or locking it. Three new config keys:

- `camera-pitch-deg` (15..85), vertical tilt baked into every
  engine init. The slider in the editor previews live as you drag.
- `camera-bearing-deg` (0..359), horizontal rotation, same live
  preview. Wraps to `[0, 360)` so a stale 720 deg in the YAML
  reads as 0 instead of putting the map in an unreachable pose.
- `camera-locked` (boolean), when on, manual drag-rotate +
  drag-pitch are inert on the canvas, pinch-rotate is disabled
  too, and the idle auto-orbit is suspended so the configured pose
  is the only pose the user ever sees. Lock + auto-rotate are
  mutually exclusive at runtime, the auto-orbit code reads the
  lock flag every tick.

Editor: "Camera" block inside the UI section with a pitch slider,
a bearing slider, a lock toggle, and a "Reset" button anchored
bottom-right that clears all three keys, releases the lock and
drives the engine back to the hemisphere-aware default pose
(north up in SH, south up in NH, pitch 55).

Live preview rides the engine directly via setCameraBearing /
setCameraPitch / setCameraLocked instead of going through a
config commit, so a slider drag never respawns the WebGL context.
The values are written to YAML in parallel (debounced) so the
next natural respawn boots from the chosen pose.

### Combined signed grid entity

- New `grid-power-entity` accepts a single signed sensor whose value
  carries the flow direction (Fronius `P_Grid`, Shelly EM, P1 net
  power, …) instead of two separate import / export meters. When it
  is set it owns both chips and supersedes `grid-import-entity` /
  `grid-export-entity`: a non-negative reading lights the IMPORT chip
  (the EXPORT chip hides), a negative reading lights the EXPORT chip,
  so only the active direction shows.
- Works with a power sensor (W / kW / MW, the value IS the signed
  watts) or a signed net-energy sensor (Wh / kWh / MWh whose total
  falls while exporting, the bracketed slope IS the signed watts). A
  list is summed, e.g. three signed per-phase sensors into one net.
  The whole live + scrub derivation rides the existing per-entity
  buffer / recorder-backfill machinery, so multi-tariff and combined
  installs share the same slope path.
- `grid-power-invert` flips the sign convention for meters that
  report grid feed-in as positive (default: positive = import).
- Editor grid section gains a combined-entity picker plus a sign
  toggle; the directional import / export pickers collapse while a
  combined entity is wired.

## v1.8.1

> Point-fix release on top of v1.8.0. v1.8.0 is withdrawn from the
> release timeline, its grid IN / OUT chips were unusable past the
> first six hours of scrub, the day-strip labels were misaligned,
> the sun bead flickered through camera rotations, and the cloud
> dome retirement was not reflected in the docs. v1.8.1 is the
> first build of the cycle that reads as the intended product.

### Grid IN / OUT, full audit + rewrite

- Sample timestamps now come from the entity's `last_updated`
  instead of the wall clock at refresh time, so the slope reflects
  when HA actually observed the value.
- Slope is taken across a bracketed pair of samples whose time
  span is at least 60 s. When the immediate before/after bracket
  sits too close together (5 s pushes on a 1 Wh meter), the
  bracket extends outward until the span clears the noise floor.
  Kills the 1 Wh-quantum-into-720 W-spike pattern.
- Multi-tariff installs (HP / HC) rank by the LAST REAL VALUE
  TRANSITION, not the latest poll, so the entity that actually
  incremented most recently always wins the chip. Live lookback
  10 min covers Linky histo mode (10 min push cadence).
- Recorder backfill window 72 h to match the timeline's visible
  past range. `pickBracket()` returns null when a scrub target
  sits more than 10 min before the buffer's first sample, the
  chip hides cleanly instead of showing a stale constant slope.
- Negative readings clamp to 0 in both live and scrub: a negative
  IMPORT is an EXPORT moment the export chip already reports.
- Bead cadence is now LINEAR in frequency (`dur = MIN * CAP /
  watts`, clamped to `[MIN, MAX]`), so twice the power gives
  twice the speed. Caps tuned to round residential thresholds:
  5 kW import, 1 kW export.

### Day-strip vertical centring + smartphone fit

The date / kWh pair on the bottom strip now shares one baseline
geometry across all four label states (bold today, regular past,
italic forecast, regular non-today). Both spans land on the same
font-size + 18 px line-height, on the HA frontend font stack
(`--mdc-typography-body1-font-family`, `--ha-font-family`,
`--paper-font-common-base_-_font-family`, Roboto fallback). The
strip itself is `box-sizing: border-box` so the inner content
area is exactly 18 px and the line box fills it without leftover
space. Font clamped to 6-9 px so the pair fits the narrower
per-day cells a portrait smartphone produces. Cramped-cell
kWh-hide threshold dropped to 48 px so the last day's forecast
stays visible when the timeline ends mid-day.

### Sun -> PV ray, no more flicker or chip overrun

- The bead was riding on a circle whose `cx` / `cy` plus a
  relative path mutated two attributes per rotation frame; the
  SMIL interpolation jittered between the old and new base.
  Switched to an absolute-path bead with `cx` / `cy` at the
  origin, single-attribute updates keep the animation continuous
  through camera drags.
- The ray + bead lived in the same SVG as the sun disc, whose
  depth split brought the SVG above the PV chip on the sun's
  near half of the sky. Moved the ray + bead to a dedicated SVG
  fixed at z 7, the chip background now always occludes the ray
  endpoint at the chip border. The sun disc keeps its depth
  split so it still passes in front of / behind the home cluster
  depending on bearing.

### Home click zone follows the building shape

The silhouette polygons now receive pointer events themselves,
so a click on any visible part of the focal building opens the
dashboard, regardless of how the 120 px circular hitbox lines
up against the projected centroid. The circular hitbox stays as
a fallback for tiny / distant buildings.

### Dome + LiDAR sliders harmonised

Both pills now share the same min-height, 16 px icons and anchor
rail, and both slide UP from below the card on mode entry and
slide DOWN out of view on mode exit (mirroring the timeline's
own enter / exit). Slider retreat fires immediately on
toggle-off, in parallel with the mode's own fade-out instead of
after it.

### Editor + docs freshness

- Grid section in the visual editor moved between PV and
  Shading, so the energy-producing sources stay grouped.
- README + ARCHITECTURE: the on-ground cloud-cover disc bullet
  is gone (the chip + dome toggle at the top of the card
  replaced it). The Depth-of-field veil bullet is gone (the
  effect is no longer in the rendering pipeline). Grid IN / OUT
  chips added to the "at a glance" feature list, with
  `grid-import-entity` / `grid-export-entity` rows in the config
  table. `cloud-color` description updated to reflect the dome
  bands.
- Project-wide audit pass: em-dashes replaced with commas in
  every source comment, every i18n locale label and the README
  + CHANGELOG. Decorative section dividers removed from
  `engine/buildings.ts`. Dead `shouldShowDomeChip()` helper
  removed from `card/shadingDome.ts`. Unused `PV_LEG_OFFSET_PX`
  constant + its `void` silencer removed from `helios-card.ts`,
  along with a sibling `void batteryCharging;` that was
  silencing a variable the very next line consumes.

### Other

- Cloud-cover curve in the timeline chart bumped from
  `fill-opacity: 0.25` to `0.45` so it stays readable through
  the irradiance fill painted on top.

## v1.8.0

> Accelerated release to address performance regressions reported after
> v1.7.0. Some roadmap items (notably the new LiDAR providers) are
> deferred. Apologies for the delay on those, they remain priority for
> the next cycle. Stabilising the rendering took precedence over
> extending coverage for this one.

### Home Assistant harmonisation

The card now reads the active HA theme directly via
`hass.themes.darkMode` instead of exposing its own toggle. Every chip,
leader, chart and editor control consumes HA design tokens
(`--primary-color`, `--card-background-color`, `--divider-color`,
`--ha-card-border-*`, `--energy-solar-color`,
`--energy-grid-consumption-color`, `--energy-battery-in-color`, etc.).
The card also picks up the HA frontend default border / radius / box-
shadow, so Helios sits visually alongside the other Energy dashboard
cards. Users familiar with the HA Energy dashboard recognise the same
colour vocabulary and chip language, and an HA theme switch now flips
the card automatically.

The legacy `card-theme: light | dark` YAML option is gone. When the
editor opens, retired keys are silently scrubbed from the config.

### Performance and stability

- WebGL "too many active contexts" fix in dashboard edit mode. The
  mount / unmount loop HA triggers during the edit-mode UI animation
  is neutralised (`preview: false`, 1 s first-spawn debounce,
  `isConnected` gates on every deferred spawn path). Engines no
  longer pile up and the browser's WebGL pool stays healthy.
- `LidarViewLayer.setData()` memoised on the raster signature.
  Re-toggling LiDAR view without moving the map short-circuits the
  Mercator double loop and the GPU buffer uploads. ~100-300 ms gain.
- Shading dome animations revised: entry and exit play symmetrically
  with the chip + timeline transitions.
- Home glow refreshed after exiting LiDAR (the projections were
  frozen at the bearing of toggle-on).
- Proportional grid IN / OUT bead animation, tied to the live power
  (cap 10 kW import, 1 kW export, idle below 5 W).
- Dependencies bumped to their latest stable versions (Vite 8,
  TypeScript 6, pbf 5, @mapbox/vector-tile 3, terser 5.48). Bundle
  drops from ~2986 KB to ~2208 KB (-26 %, gzipped -13 %).

### Grid Import / Export

- Multi-tariff support. `grid-import-entity` and `grid-export-entity`
  accept either a string or an array of entities. Typical case: French
  Linky EASF01 (peak hours) + EASF02 (off-peak hours). The visual
  editor exposes an editable list with up to 8 sources per side.
- "Last-changed wins" logic. When several entities are wired, the
  chip displays the watts of whichever entity moved most recently
  (the active tariff).
- Recorder backfill at boot. A 1 h history pull from the HA recorder
  seeds the rolling buffer for each grid entity on first refresh, so
  the slope is meaningful right away even when the live integration
  is silent for minutes (slow-polling Linky TIC, etc.).
- Rolling window 60 min, up to 800 samples per entity.
- No more 0 W seeding. If no derivation has landed yet, the chip
  stays on the last computed value instead of falling back to 0.
- Import / export leaders + beads driven by the live power.

### Home hub and leaders

- Solid drop-leader between the home pill and the projected ground
  at the 3D building, painted in HA primary colour. The home cluster
  is lifted a notch to leave the leader visible.
- Permanent home glow (opacity 0.25 at rest) bumping to 0.85 with a
  thicker drop-shadow on hover.
- Larger home hitbox (120 px, z-index 55) so click / hover lands on
  the home even when chips or leaders sit under the pointer.
- Sun ray bead. The sun → PV chip ray now carries a circular bead
  instead of an arrow, speed tied to the live irradiance.
- Battery + grid leaders use a quadratic fillet on the L-shape to
  match the cloud-layer leaders.

### Cloud cover

- The fourth mode-bar button is gone. The central cloud chip itself
  toggles 3 per-layer sub-chips (low / mid / high) with a cascade
  fade-in animation.
- Three L-leaders connect the toggle to the sub-chips, converging on
  a central junction with a vertical trunk.
- Auto-OFF when switching to LiDAR or Shading mode so the sub-chips
  don't leak into the active layer.

### Timeline and clock chip

- Top-left date / time chip pulled up to z-index 1000, no longer
  crossed by the solar arc nor by the dome overlays.
- Mobile day-strip: tighter gap / padding / font clamps. The kWh
  annotation hides below 90 px cell width.
- Night hatches and day separators alpha bumped to stay legible in
  dark mode.
- Hover tooltip uses a 12 px border-radius matching the chip language.
- Theme-aware prediction colour: darker on light theme, lighter on
  dark theme.
- Timeline slides in / out from below (translateY 140 %) when
  returning to the default view.

### LiDAR mesh

- Loading feedback. Until the exposure compute lands, only the points
  and the wireframe paint in pure white. Colour-filled triangles
  appear once the exposure is ready.
- Spinner on the LiDAR mode-bar button during compute, with the other
  two mode buttons disabled to prevent state races.
- Shader shadow floor bumped (0.25 → 0.55) so the mesh stays legible
  at night when every cell is in shadow.

### Solar arc and irradiance chip

- Depth-split rendering. The half of the arc closer to the camera
  paints over the chips (z 11), the half further out paints behind
  (z 5). The sun disc follows the same rule.
- The W/m² label sits at z 13 above the front arc so it never gets
  crossed.

### PV string markers removed

The icon + leader + sphere that marked each PV string position is
removed. Backing code, CSS and engine projections are gone too
(~5 KB bundle savings).

### HA Energy auto-detect removed

The fallback that pulled entities from the HA Energy dashboard is
removed for PV, battery and grid. Resolution is now entirely driven
by the explicit YAML keys. Diagnosing a chip at 0 W is much simpler:
if the chip is silent, the configured entity is the one responsible,
no opaque fallback shadowing the source.

### Diagnostics and hygiene

- Every runtime `console.info` / `console.log` debug call is gone.
  The console stays silent in steady state, only genuine warnings
  (context lost, fetch failed) remain.
- Engine cleanup drops `_lidarViewLayer` + `_lidarRaster` explicitly
  after `map.remove()` so dead GL handles don't get pinned across
  editor respawns.

### i18n

- 9 new grid keys translated across every supported locale (EN, FR,
  DE, ES, IT, NL, PT, NO, PL, CS, SV).

## v1.7.0

Headline release on top of v1.6.4. Thirty-five alpha iterations + three
betas, condensed below. The deliberate scope choice for this cycle was
"refine the prediction rather than add more providers", so the LiDAR
provider count is unchanged (10) and the energy went into the live
irradiance overlay, the adaptive shading map, multi-battery support and
the polish pass on the dashboard + layer transitions. Users in
uncovered regions can prepare their own raster via
[helios-lidar.org](https://helios-lidar.org).

### Live LiDAR irradiance overlay

The LiDAR-View overlay now paints every loaded raster cell as a
wireframe + filled triangles, shaded in real time by a per-cell
raymarch from each cell toward the sun against the loaded nDSM.
Lit cells glow warm (warm-tinted at the irradiance peak), shadowed
cells dim out. The compute runs in 32-row chunks per
requestAnimationFrame tick so the main thread stays responsive while
the irradiance map fills in row-by-row, no freeze even on
high-precision rasters. Toggled from the three-segment top-right
mode bar (Layer / LiDAR / Dome); a bottom-of-card slider tunes the
overlay opacity live. The five previous per-element visual config
keys (`lidar-view-point-color` / `-point-opacity` /
`-wireframe` / `-wireframe-color` / `-wireframe-opacity`) collapsed
into that single slider; the legacy keys are silently stripped on
first edit. Only `lidar-view-point-size` remains tunable from the
editor.

### Adaptive shading map

A second learning layer sits on top of the 5-day calibration: each
cell of a polar grid (sun azimuth × sun altitude × cloud-cover bin)
holds the average actual / predicted ratio observed at that
combination. The forecast then bends at the right time of day for
tree shadows, neighbouring roofs and other obstacles the LiDAR
didn't capture. Visualisable from the editor as a hemispheric "dome"
overlay (Shadows segment of the mode bar), with stats and per-bin
import / export / reset. Builds up from the user's own data over a
few weeks; until then the scalar calibration carries the load.

### Multi-battery banks

New `batteries:` config array declares any number of physical
battery banks side-by-side (house + garage + standalone hybrid,
mixed-vendor BMS, etc.). The chip on the card stays single,
aggregating the banks as a capacity-weighted SoC + summed signed
power. Each bank carries its own `power-invert` flag (per-vendor
sign convention) and an optional `capacity-kwh` weight. Editor UI
mirrors the multi-array PV pattern (add / remove rows, individual
collapsible cards). Legacy flat `battery-soc-entity` /
`battery-power-entity` / `battery-power-invert` keys keep working:
they are wrapped as a single-bank list under the hood and stripped
on the first edit via the new editor UI. Mixed-vendor power
readings (one bank in W, another in kW) are normalised to watts
before being summed so the aggregate is coherent.

### Inverter cutoff guard

New `inverter-cutoff-soc-pct` config gates the shading-map trainer:
when the user's hybrid inverter clamps PV output once the battery
reaches its set ceiling, every observation bucket where every bank
reached the cutoff is skipped, so the inverter-blocked production
doesn't train as phantom shadow at the matching sun position.
Per-bucket min-SoC across banks is the gate signal, so a half-full
sibling bank correctly trains the bucket while one full bank does
not block it. Logs a console warning when the cutoff is armed but
no bank exposes a SoC entity (silent-guard misconfig).

### Dashboard counter-up

Headline kWh figures on the dashboard (produced, forecast, refined)
now tick up from 0 to their real value with a 700 ms cubic ease-out
the moment the user opens detail mode. Delta % and peak time stay
anchored on the real values so they don't sweep through nonsense
intermediate numbers.

### Depth-of-field veil

Permanent across modes, ultra-subtle (0.6 px backdrop blur) shaped
by a radial mask centred on the home's current screen position.
Fully transparent inside the inner disc (no blur at the focal
point), full blur at the edges. Sits between the basemap and the
chips so the UI stays crisp regardless. Subliminal on its own,
gives the card a gentle peripheral out-of-focus feel that mimics
DoF at distance.

### About section in the editor

New collapsible section pinned at the very bottom of the visual
editor, carries: the running version (inlined at build time from
package.json), a pointer at the companion site
[helios-lidar.org](https://helios-lidar.org), the two source-code
repos (Helios + Helios-Lidar) with GitHub icons, and a short
appreciation paragraph + Buy Me A Coffee link styled in the BMC
yellow. Translated into all 11 locales.

### Memory hygiene + correctness pass

A round of audits before the final tag closed:

* Four memory leaks identified across the engine lifecycle, the
  chunked exposure loop pinning the dead engine after rapid config
  edits, the LiDAR-View custom layer leaking its 4 GPU buffers +
  shader program on iOS Safari, the editor's reset-feedback timer
  firing on dead elements, and the styleimagemissing handler
  surviving past cleanup as an anonymous lambda. All four closed,
  so the "must refresh after several edits" symptom is gone.
* DTM no-data gap in `pv-shading.ts` now falls back to flat-ground
  at the offending step instead of skipping the obstacle entirely,
  fixed in both `isPanelShaded` and `computeLidarCellExposureRows`,
  was under-detecting shading on panels near LiDAR coverage edges.
* LiDAR exposure raster-swap race fixed (size guard in setExposure
  + raster-identity check in the chunked tick + stale-sun
  re-check), no more one-frame ghosting on precision change or
  view locked 30 s behind the cursor during a rapid timeline scrub.
* Calibration day-boundary no longer over-counts ~1 h of the
  previous evening into the new day on sparse cumulative-energy
  sensors (both samples of a delta pair must fall inside the day).
* Multi-bank power aggregation normalises to watts before summing
  (mixed-vendor W + kW installs were producing nonsense before).

### Editor polish

* Battery banks AND PV arrays are now fully wipeable from the
  visual editor: removing the last row drops the `batteries:` or
  `pv-arrays:` key entirely, so the chip / forecast cleanly falls
  back to "not configured". Empty arrays are honoured on re-read so
  the section shows just an "+ Add" button.
* Chip fade-in / fade-out across mode toggles got a
  `will-change: opacity` hint, the CSS rules were already correct
  in both directions but the browser dropped frames on chips
  inside transform-less wrappers (time-bar, solar-svg) under load,
  producing intermittent "sometimes works, sometimes doesn't"
  behaviour. Now bulletproof, GPU-composited.

### Locales

Three new locales added: Czech, Polish, Swedish. Total: 11
(cs, de, en, es, fr, it, nl, no, pl, pt, sv). Every new key
introduced this cycle (multi-battery editor + About section +
LiDAR-View hint rewrite) was translated natively into all 11.

### Repo split

The Python preparation toolchain (raw LAZ / LAS → 2-band COG that
the companion site uses server-side) moved out of this repo into
its own [Helios-Lidar](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios-Lidar)
repository. Card-side and pipeline-side concerns are now in two
separate repos kept loosely coupled by the documented COG output
format. The local `tools/` and `data/` directories have been
removed from this tree accordingly.

### License

Switched from MIT to GPL-3.0-or-later. LICENSE file ships the
canonical GPL-3.0 text prepended with the project's copyright
notice; README badge + footer + package.json `license` field
all updated.

## v1.6.4

Point release on top of v1.6.3 with one behavioural change.

### Heartbeat ping removed

The anonymous install heartbeat introduced in v1.6.3 (a once-per-
day POST of a random UUIDv4 to helios-lidar.org) is gone. The
card no longer emits any beacon, and the `helios-anon-stats`
config key is no longer read. Anyone setting it explicitly to
`false` can leave the line in their YAML (it's now a no-op) or
remove it.

Install analytics are now derived from public GitHub Releases
download counts on the helios-lidar.org landing page, which keeps
the same informational value without a client-side ping.

## v1.6.3

Headline release on top of v1.6.2. Sixteen beta iterations
condensed below. The big themes :

### Terrain-aware LiDAR shading

The pre-1.6.3 ray-march in `pv-shading.ts` assumed flat ground at
every cell of the nDSM, which under- or over-counted shading by
the slope between the panel and a far obstacle on any non-flat
install. The companion pipeline at [helios-lidar.org](https://helios-lidar.org)
now ships a 2-band COG (band 1 = nDSM, band 2 = DTM) and the
card lifts both into absolute Z anchored at the panel's local
ground, so a 5 m building 50 m east on terrain that rises 8 m
correctly reads as a 13 m obstacle (and a 5 m building on
terrain that drops 8 m correctly reads as -3 m, i.e. below the
panel and invisible to the sun). Legacy single-band rasters
(public providers + pre-v1.6.3 local COGs) fall back to the
flat-ground geometry transparently, no breakage.

US-foot LAZ files (a common hurdle for North American users)
also got fixed in the pipeline: the source CRS gets reprojected
to the nearest UTM zone in metres before rasterisation, so
6 ftUS-pitch panels no longer end up encoded as 6 m and skew
the shading.

### PV configuration : per-string kWp + inverter PMax

`pv-arrays[].peak-kwp` replaces the abstract `share` field for
multi-string installs. Each row carries its real nameplate;
total install power is the sum, no more "60/40 with 5 kWp total"
shorthand. New top-level `pv-inverter-max-kw` clips the forecast
at the inverter's nameplate so an oversized DC array (typical
European 6.4 kWp behind a 5 kW inverter) doesn't show a peak
above what the hardware delivers. Editor + 8 locales updated.
Legacy share-based configs keep working unchanged.

### 5-day rolling forecast calibration, now everywhere

The dashboard already nudged its "refined" headline by the
5-day actual / model ratio; v1.6.3 propagates the same `cal.ratio`
to the dotted forecast curve, the per-day kWh chips on the
timeline strip, the hover tooltip's PV value, AND the live PV
chip when scrubbing into the future. All four readouts now
agree at any scrub instant.

### Timeline overhaul

* **Hover tooltip** on both chart cards (irradiance / cloud + PV).
  Pointer-move draws a vertical guide line + colour-coded dots
  (mdi:white-balance-sunny, mdi:cloud-outline, mdi:flash) at the
  cursor position. PV row skipped silently when no entity is
  configured. Works on mobile too: a touch drag updates the
  tooltip the same way as desktop hover.
* **Night zones** as diagonal-hatch overlays from sunset[N] to
  sunrise[N+1] on both chart cards, with dotted vertical day /
  night boundary lines. Same hatch + boundary on the dashboard's
  today chart for one unified visual vocabulary.
* **Future-mask wash** anchored at "now" so the forecast portion
  of every curve + the night-zone hatch fades together. Past
  reads punchy; forecast reads as forecast.
* **Day-strip** below the cards: one bordered bar with dotted
  midnight separators and per-day kWh totals; the cells size their
  text via container queries so a 4-day mobile view doesn't
  smash the date + kWh together.
* **Balanced chart heights** (48 px each) so PV no longer looks
  like a sparkline below the irradiance / cloud card.
* **Cursor weights bumped** to read through the future wash.
  Negative PV readings (net-meter dawn / dusk noise) clamp at 0
  in the tooltip + the live chip + the dashboard headline.

### Camera : pitch on vertical drag

Vertical drag on the canvas tilts the camera; horizontal drag
keeps the existing bearing rotation. Pitch clamped to
[15°, 85°], so the user can dive almost top-down or peek almost
flat against the ground without ever passing through it.
Two-finger pinch-rotate stays with MapLibre's built-in handler.

### PV home-anchor as a perspective ground ring

The single screen-space disc at the home gets replaced by a
2.5 m stroked ring projected through the map's camera matrices.
Lies flat on the ground around the home, aplated by pitch and
rotated by bearing. The back arc of the ring is masked by the
home silhouette (same polygons the home-glow uses), so the
building visually sits inside the ring. Pulse animation rides
through the bead arrival cycle.

### LiDAR cast-shadow quality

The cluster cap dropped from 400 cells to 80 (~16 m² target
area) so convex hulls trace L-roofs and zigzagging tree rows
much closer to their real outline; the shadow raster size is
tied to the existing `lidar-precision` knob (low / medium =
1024 px, high = 2048 px) so the median user pays no extra
mobile cost and power-users opt in to the sharper edges. Shadow
recompute is also coalesced into a 100 ms debounce during
timeline scrub, so dragging the cursor at high precision no
longer feels glued.

### Smaller polish that ships in 1.6.3 too

* **LiDAR chip cluster** redesigned as a row-reverse pair (chip
  on the left, mode toggle on the right), both clickable, with
  three coverage states (no provider / online / local) and the
  active-on theme matching the scrub clock on the opposite
  corner. Chip text comes from the `lidarViewChipLabel` i18n
  key ("Vue LiDAR" / "LiDAR view" / ...).
* **Forecast curves at 0.7 px stroke** (was 1.4 px) so dense
  variation reads as a hairline trace instead of a smudged band.
* **PV predicted icon in the timeline tooltip** uses the lighter
  `lerpHexToward(pvColor, '#ffffff', 0.55)` tint, matching the
  dashboard's dotted forecast convention.
* **Dashboard tomorrow card calibration tooltip** can finally
  paint above the battery card (`:has()` selector lifts the
  hovered card to a higher z-index).
* **Editor BYO LiDAR hint** rewritten to lead with
  helios-lidar.org (the easy path) and mention the local
  `tools/lidar/` helpers as the fallback. Now renders the
  inline `[text](url)` syntax as real `<a>` anchors via a
  scheme-restricted markdown-link helper.
* **Sunrise / sunset arc icons removed** ; the arc shape on the
  3D map already signals them and the icons piled up visually
  against the LiDAR shadow blobs on the horizon. Replaced by
  diagonal night-zone hatching on the dashboard chart for the
  same indication on the 2D charts.
* **Neighbour-building outlines** dropped (visual noise on dense
  streets); the home outline stays.
* **Day-strip date font** bumped (`clamp(9px, 11cqw, 13px)`) and
  the cells use container queries so the layout adapts to any
  card width.
* **Detail-panel `.dash-card` entry animation** ends on
  `transform: none` so the stacking context releases after the
  fade-in and tooltips can paint above sibling cards.
* **HACS repo description** refreshed to match what the card
  actually does in 1.6.x.

---

## v1.6.2

Precision release on top of v1.6.1: two upgrades to the PV
prediction model and one UI cleanup on the LiDAR-View toggle. No
breaking changes, every existing config keeps working unchanged.

### PV thermal derating

The PV forecast now accounts for the cell temperature climb under
sun and the convective cooling under wind, using the classic
Sandia / NOCT pipeline:

* The Open-Meteo fetch now pulls `temperature_2m` + `wind_speed_10m`
  alongside the existing cloud + shortwave variables.
* Cell temperature is estimated with `T_cell = T_air + (NOCT − 20) /
  800 W/m² × GHI − 1.5 × wind`, then the output is derated by
  `1 + γ_pmp × (T_cell − 25)` with γ_pmp = −0.0040 /°C (the typical
  monocrystalline silicon coefficient).
* Plumbed through every PV computation site: live chip, scrub
  preview, dashboard "today" / "tomorrow" graphs, forecast
  calibration. On a hot summer noon at 35 °C ambient and ~900 W/m²
  the derating reduces the predicted peak by ~13 %, which is the
  bulk of the model bias the rolling calibration ratio was
  previously absorbing as a flat multiplier.
* Falls back cleanly when the model didn't return temperature or
  wind: multiplier stays at 1 and the forecast reduces bit-for-bit
  to the previous Haurwitz + Liu-Jordan output.

### LiDAR-aware shading on the PV forecast

When a LiDAR provider covers the home (or a BYO local-nDSM raster
is configured), the PV forecast ray-marches from each PV array
along the sun direction and zeroes the direct-beam component on
arrays whose line-of-sight to the sun is blocked by a building or
tree. The diffuse + ground-reflected components are kept (an
obstacle blocks the sun ray but not the upper hemisphere of sky),
so a shaded panel doesn't drop to zero, just to the ~25-30 % of
clear-sky output the diffuse + reflected terms contribute.

* New `height` field per entry in `pv-arrays` (metres above ground,
  default 5). Used as the ray's starting altitude so a panel on a
  first-floor roof clears a low fence the same-orientation
  ground-mounted array would sit in the shadow of.
* Bilinear sample of the loaded nDSM, 2 m step, 200 m max reach.
  Same buffer the LiDAR View overlay paints, no extra fetch.
* For installs with `pv-arrays` declared at distinct coordinates,
  each entry is shaded independently. So a roof-east array can be
  shaded by a tall neighbour at 8 am while the roof-west array on
  the same property is fully lit.
* Skipped silently when no LiDAR raster is loaded (no providers
  match the home, no BYO nDSM configured), so installs outside
  LiDAR coverage continue to produce the legacy forecast.

### LiDAR-View toggle visual cleanup

The toggle chip on the top-right rail now mirrors the date chip on
the opposite rail exactly: 12 px Roboto 600, line-height 1.2,
padding 2 px 8 px, 22 px tall, mixed-case `LiDAR` label. The 1.6.1
chip used 11 px uppercase Roboto with `line-height: 1`, which left
zero slack for the font's natural cap-height asymmetry; the visible
glyph centre drifted up or down against the icon depending on the
browser (Chromium, Firefox and WebKit each shifted it by a
different fraction of a px). The new recipe centres consistently
across every engine, the same way the date chip has always done.

### Notes for users

The new fields are opt-in but the temperature derating activates
automatically as soon as v1.6.2 is installed, since the weather
fetch starts pulling temperature + wind without any config change.
Expect the forecast to read **a few percent lower** at the midday
peak on hot clear days and a few percent higher on cold clear
winter days; the self-calibration ratio will absorb the residual
within a few sunny days.

For LiDAR-aware shading to kick in, the home needs to be inside a
LiDAR provider's coverage (one of the 10 native providers shipped
with the card, or a BYO local-nDSM via the `lidar-local-ndsm-*`
keys). Outside coverage, the forecast falls back to the existing
geometry-only model.

The companion site [helios-lidar.org](https://helios-lidar.org) is
also bumped to 1.6.2 in lock-step.

---

## v1.6.1

Hotfix on top of v1.6.0 addressing two visible bugs surfaced by
community feedback on the Reddit launch thread. Scope deliberately
kept tight; LiDAR coverage expansion and other feature work moves
to v1.7.

### Fixes

* **Refined-forecast tooltip clipping** ,
  [#16](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/issues/16). The
  hover explanation behind the "→ X kWh affiné" chip on the
  AUJOURD'HUI and DEMAIN dashboard cards used the same horizontal
  anchor on both layouts, which only fit the AUJOURD'HUI
  two-column headline. The DEMAIN headline is a single
  left-aligned column, so the chip sits on the left and the
  tooltip extended past the card's left edge into ha-card's
  overflow clip. Each card now anchors its tooltip on the side
  opposite the chip so it grows into the card interior:
  `.dash-card.dash-today .dash-stat-refined::after { right: 0 }`
  and `.dash-card.dash-tomorrow .dash-stat-refined::after { left:
  0 }`.
* **Black-map after location change on Firefox**, when the user
  switches `home-latitude` / `home-longitude` in the editor
  preview on Firefox, the previous MapLibre engine's WebGL
  context wasn't fully released by the time the next engine tried
  to bind one, yielding a black canvas. Engine init now waits one
  animation frame between cleanup and new MapLibre allocation
  when there was a previous engine, giving Firefox time to
  release the context. No effect on Chrome (the extra 16 ms sits
  inside the existing 500 ms editor debounce).

## v1.6.0

The biggest iteration since the OpenFreeMap migration. Three
headline tracks: a GPU-resident LiDAR View overlay, a complete
dashboard rework with a learning forecast, and a card-wide
architecture split that broke the two ~5k-line monoliths into
focused subsystem modules. Plus per-array PV configuration (with
optional GPS), a reset cache control, a new German LiDAR provider,
external solar-radiation sensor input, and a long list of editor
polish.

### Highlights

* **Forecast calibration**. The dashboard learns from the last 5
  completed days how the model under- or over-predicts your
  installation and surfaces a refined value beside each PRÉVU
  figure with a hover hint that spells out the calibration window
  ("→ 18.2 kWh refined (-8 %)"). Window clamps the multiplier to
  ±50 %, falls back silently when fewer than 2 past days carry
  enough production to derive a stable ratio, and never publishes
  anything until the historical fetch has landed.
* **Dashboard rework**. The detail-mode panel is rebuilt around
  three responsive sections: Today (produced + refined forecast +
  dual peak readouts + cumulative chart with sunrise / sunset
  markers + live now cursor + smart-positioned hover tooltip),
  Tomorrow (full-day forecast + peak hour, side by side with
  Battery when configured, full width otherwise) and Battery
  (vessel + charge / discharge totals). Date chips next to
  AUJOURD'HUI / DEMAIN confirm the two pure-forecast cards cover
  different days.
* **LiDAR View overlay**. A WebGL custom layer paints every loaded
  LiDAR cell as a small dot in screen space, optionally with a
  wireframe overlay. GPU-resident, re-rasterised by MapLibre on
  every transform with no JS-side redraw, so panning and rotating
  through a dense forest stay smooth. Distance fade, theme-aware
  colours, configurable display radius, soft enter / exit
  transitions with a scanner pulse on activation.
* **Architecture refactor**. `helios-card.ts` (5218 lines) and
  `helios-engine.ts` (4437 lines) were split into focused modules
  under `src/card/` and `src/engine/`, each owning one piece of
  functionality (data fetch, render, input, util, lifecycle on the
  card side; physics, geometry, animation, layer on the engine
  side). The two top-level files now act as orchestrators that
  delegate to their subsystems through small structural host
  interfaces. Lit reactivity stays natural, no service classes, no
  mixin gymnastics, no `requestUpdate()` ceremony.

### PV configuration

* **Per-array GPS coordinates**. Each entry in `pv-arrays` accepts
  optional `latitude` / `longitude` fields. When set and different
  from the home (> 10 m), the forecast model runs at the panel's
  true coordinates and a small solar-panel icon in the configured
  PV colour appears on the map at that position. Useful for ground-
  mounted arrays in a clearing while the home itself sits under
  trees.
* **Multi-orientation PV layout** (`pv-arrays`). One YAML entry per
  group of co-oriented panels (`tilt`, `azimuth`, `share`).
  Forecast model evaluates each entry separately and weights by its
  share, so split-array installs (east + west rows, roof + balcony,
  three-pitch roofs) get a correct prediction instead of the
  single-orientation approximation. Shares auto-normalise so 50/50,
  60/60 and 1/1 all produce the same forecast. Visual editor
  exposes a repeatable section with `+ Add row` / `Remove` and
  renameable rows; legacy `pv-tilt` / `pv-azimuth` keep working
  unchanged. Closes [#8](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/issues/8),
  contributed by [@i6media](https://github.com/i6media) in
  [PR #10](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/pull/10).
* **Battery power sign toggle**. New `battery-power-invert` config
  option multiplies live + historical battery power by -1 before
  storage, so installs where the upstream entity reports charging
  as negative (some GivEnergy / GivTCP setups) align with Helios's
  internal "positive = charging" convention without a template
  sensor in front.

### LiDAR

* **Germany (NRW) provider**. Geobasis NRW publishes a pre-computed
  nDOM raster via WCS GeoTIFF, covering Nordrhein-Westfalen
  (~18M people). Single fetch, routes through the same shared
  pipeline as every other provider.
* **Poland (GUGiK NMPT) provider**. National pre-computed DSM via
  WCS 2.0.1, GeoTIFF Float32, EPSG:4326 natively supported (no
  reprojection round-trip). ~38M people. Single fetch.
* **Canada (NRCan HRDEM Mosaic) provider**. National DSM coverage
  via GeoServer WCS 1.1.1. 1-2 m LiDAR-derived in the populated
  south, satellite-derived further north. ~38M people. Single
  fetch.
* **Austria, Styria (Steiermark) provider**. Two-fetch DSM-DTM
  subtraction from the Land Steiermark ALS Höhen-
  / Geländeinformation WCS services. ~1.2M people. First
  Austrian Land integrated, opens the door to the eight others.
* **Austria, Tirol (Tyrol) provider**. Two-fetch DSM-DTM
  subtraction from the Land Tirol terrain WCS (DGM + DOM 5 m).
  ~760K people.
* **Germany, Brandenburg + Berlin provider**. LGB bDOM + DGM
  1 m WCS, two fetches subtracted client-side. Single integration
  covers both Lands (Brandenburg ~2.5M + Berlin ~3.6M = ~6.1M
  people).
* **Germany, Baden-Württemberg provider**. LGL INSPIRE DOM5 +
  DGM1 WCS, two fetches subtracted client-side. ~11.3M people,
  Germany's third most populous Land.
* **United States, Vermont provider**. VCGI statewide
  pre-normalised nDSM via ArcGIS Image Server exportImage,
  single-fetch Float32 GeoTIFF, no DSM-DTM round-trip. ~645K
  people. First US-state native provider in Helios.
* **Worldwide LiDAR provider registry**. New
  [`LIDAR_PROVIDERS.html`](./LIDAR_PROVIDERS.html) lists every
  public elevation / LiDAR source inspected (integrated,
  verified compatible but pending, partially compatible,
  incompatible) with status, endpoint, curl-verified example fetch
  URL ready to paste in a browser, and an inline SVG world map
  overlaying the integrated providers' coverage bboxes.
* **BYO local nDSM provider**. New `lidar-local-ndsm-*` config
  family lets users in regions without a built-in provider host
  their own height-above-ground GeoTIFF and have Helios use it as
  the shadow source inside a user-defined bounding box. Takes
  precedence over public providers inside the bbox; outside the
  bbox, the regular fallback chain (public → footprints) applies
  unchanged. Closes [#5](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/issues/5),
  contributed by [@jourdant](https://github.com/jourdant) in
  [PR #5](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/pull/5), original
  idea credited to [@stephenwq](https://github.com/stephenwq).
* **LiDAR prep tools**. A `tools/lidar/` Python toolchain walks
  through the last stages of nDSM preparation: inspect a GeoTIFF,
  convert to a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF for efficient browser
  streaming, generate a synthetic test raster. Detailed guide and
  `uv` setup in [`tools/lidar/README.md`](tools/lidar/README.md).
  Closes [#11](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/issues/11),
  contributed by [@jourdant](https://github.com/jourdant) in
  [PR #11](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/pull/11).
* **LiDAR View overlay**. Detailed under Highlights above. Editor
  promotion to its own section, native-pitch raster + per-view
  radius filter, ~30-50× perf win on the hot loop, theme-aware
  colours, distance fade, soft enter / exit transitions, scanner
  pulse on activation, debug overlay for diagnostics.
* **LiDAR View display radius**. Decoupled from `building-radius`
  so the dot cloud can extend past the visible buildings (the
  trees that cast the surrounding shadows often sit beyond the
  building disc).

### Home Assistant integration

* **External solar-radiation sensor input**. New optional
  `solar-radiation-entity` config pulls live + historical W/m²
  from a configured sensor and pushes them to the engine, so the
  irradiance display + chart prefer the physical sensor over the
  Open-Meteo model for live and past timestamps. Future
  timestamps still come from the model. Closes
  [#1](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/issues/1).
* **`home-latitude` / `home-longitude` override**. Optional
  per-card coordinates that win over `hass.config.latitude` /
  `longitude` when both parse as valid coords. Useful for shared
  HA installs, holiday / parents' homes, mobile setups, multiple
  cards on one dashboard each visualising a different place, or
  privacy-conscious users who leave `hass.config` blank.
  Contributed by [@i6media](https://github.com/i6media) in
  [PR #9](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/pull/9).
* **Card height floor**. Adds a minimum height so the card still
  reads correctly inside layouts that don't constrain its
  vertical footprint (sections view at small row counts, masonry
  with rigid columns).

### Editor

* **Reset data cache button**. New "Reset" section at the bottom
  of the editor. Wipes the cached Open-Meteo payload and the
  in-memory PV history for every Helios card open on the page,
  forcing a fresh fetch. Useful for a stuck calibration or a
  stale weather payload. HA data is never touched. Destructive
  warning above the button explains exactly what gets cleared
  and what doesn't.
* **Live editor preview**. Editor opens a live preview of the
  card so config edits show their effect before the dashboard
  reload. Engine bootstrap debounced 500 ms so quick editor
  churn doesn't burn WebGL contexts.
* **Renameable PV rows**. Each `pv-arrays` entry takes an
  optional `name`; the editor's repeatable section uses it as
  the card title, falling back to "Row N" otherwise.
* **Accordion editor**. Every section collapsible, the editor
  remembers which one is open, and only one expands at a time so
  the configuration panel stays compact.
* **Editor section reorg**. LiDAR View promoted to its own
  section. Map / UI / Buildings / Shadows / Local LiDAR groups
  rearranged for a natural top-to-bottom flow.
* **Editor vertical rhythm**. Spacing between labels, hints and
  fields tuned across the whole editor so each section reads as
  a calm vertical strip instead of a wall of inputs. Field
  helps share consistent line height and opacity, color groups
  cluster visually.
* **Single-finger auto-rotate**. The idle-camera orbit toggle
  pauses on a single-finger drag instead of requiring two
  fingers, matching the rest of MapLibre's touch input.

### Fixes

* **PV history chart spike**. Cumulative-energy sensors (Wh /
  kWh / MWh) no longer produce phantom spikes from quantization
  noise. The differentiation now holds a 3 min anchor so the
  rate averages over a window where 1 Wh integer noise is
  negligible.
* **Freeze on solar-radiation entity selection**. Selecting a
  solar-radiation entity in the editor used to freeze the card
  while the bridge pulled history. The fetch is now properly
  deferred and the engine continues rendering during the
  in-flight call. Closes
  [#12](https://github.com/ReikanYsora/Helios/issues/12).
* **Sun-ray arrow scrub**. The travelling arrow on the
  irradiance leader no longer detaches from the path when
  scrubbing the timeline back and forth. SMIL `animateMotion`
  no longer restarts on every path update; visibility is now
  gated on `_isLiveMode`.
* **Smartphone vertical alignment on PIC PRÉVU**. Icon and text
  share a single 13 px line-box with a 1 px translateY nudge on
  the uppercase glyphs so they visually centre with the icon
  instead of floating above.
* **LiDAR view button clickability**. `pointer-events` fix so
  the button receives clicks on touch devices. Button hides
  entirely when no provider covers the home, instead of
  rendering disabled.
* **LiDAR View float32 precision** on the GPU buffer (loss-of-
  precision artefacts on long lat / lon values).
* **LiDAR view layer init**. Hardened against a half-ready map
  to stop a race condition where the GL layer attached before
  MapLibre finished bootstrapping its default buffers.

### Internal

* `PAST_DAYS` bumped from 2 to 7. The timeline UI clips to the
  last 2 past days for scrub precision; the extra payload feeds
  the forecast calibration.
* PV history fetch window extended to 7 past days, in one HA
  round-trip instead of two; the chart still filters to its
  visible range.
* New `card/calibration.ts` module exporting
  `computeForecastCalibration(host)`, fed by `_chartSeries` +
  `_pvHistory` + per-day model integration.
* Window-level `helios-data-cache-reset` event bus so multiple
  cards on the same page reset their state in sync.
* `clearWeatherCache()` public helper in `engine/weather.ts`.
* `resetDataCache()` public method on both the card and the
  engine.

## v1.5.1, tilted-panel forecast, today cumulative chart, dashboard polish

Hotfix-flavoured iteration on top of v1.5.0. Focused on the issues
1.5.0's new users surfaced in the first 24 hours after release: an
over-optimistic forecast for non-horizontal installs, a dashboard /
timeline mismatch on the projected kWh, and visual polish on the new
detail panel.

**Tilted-panel forecast.** `computePvPower` gains an optional `panel`
argument carrying `tiltDeg` and `azimuthDeg`. When tilt is greater
than zero, the function switches from the horizontal-panel fast path
to a Liu-Jordan isotropic transposition: GHI is split into direct
(cos-of-incidence transposed via `R_b = cos θi / cos z`) and diffuse
(`(1 + cos β) / 2`) components plus a 20 % albedo ground-reflection
term. Two new editor config keys, `pv-tilt` (0..90 degrees) and
`pv-azimuth` (0..360, clockwise from north, 180 = south), feed the
helper `_pvPanelOrientation()` on the card side; defaults keep the
horizontal-panel behaviour bit-for-bit unchanged. Closes #3. A user
with vertical balcony panels was seeing 4.7 kWh predicted against
1.1 kWh measured. With `pv-tilt: 90` + `pv-azimuth: 180`, the
prediction lands in the realistic range and tracks reality through
the day.

**Dashboard / timeline forecast alignment.** The "Aujourd'hui" card
was displaying a forecast figure that drifted from the value shown on
the timeline above. Two root causes: (a) the cumulative-energy unit
(`kWh`) was not handled by `_pvNormalizeToWatts`, which silently
returned 0 after differentiation, zero-ing the observed contribution
in `_computeTodayHourly`; (b) the dashboard's forecast was integrated
via hourly bins while the timeline used the raw `_computeDailyKwhTotals`
path. Both fixed: the cumulative-energy path now goes straight to
watts via `value * 1000` after differentiation, and the dashboard
reads today's forecast directly from `_computeDailyKwhTotals` so the
two surfaces are guaranteed to agree.

**Today cumulative chart.** The right half of the "Aujourd'hui" card,
previously empty, now hosts a sparkline of the day's running kWh.
Past portion is drawn from raw history (cumulative-energy sensors get
a baseline-subtracted reading per sample; power sensors are
integrated by trapezoidal rule); future portion extends with the
hourly forecast bins, the boundary cleanly stitched at "now". A dot
sits on every full hour and a hover line + travelling dot reveal a
tooltip showing the exact cumulative kWh at the cursor's minute.
Gated by a CSS container query on the section (`min-width: 380px`)
so the chart only appears when the card has room to render it
readably; below that, the layout falls back to the previous two-
column shape.

**"Pas encore produit" status + skeleton placeholder.** Two new UI
states for the produced figure in the "Aujourd'hui" card: a
shimmering skeleton replaces the value while the PV history fetch is
in flight (so transient "0,0 kWh" stops reading as fact), and a
small italic line ("production pas encore démarrée" / "production
hasn't started yet" / 8 locales) sits under the value when produced
is effectively zero and the forecast still expects a peak later in
the day.

**Battery cap double-edge fix.** The battery icon in the detail
dashboard had a visible double stroke at the seam between the cap
and the cell shell. Caused by two `<rect>` elements sharing their
edge with `rx`-rounded corners pulling in the cap's bottom slightly,
exposing the shell's top stroke alongside. Replaced by a single open
`<path>` for the cap (top + two sides, no bottom edge) so the shell's
top edge becomes the only stroke at the seam.

**1 px border on travelling beads.** The animated discs that ride
the PV → home and battery ↔ PV leader lines now carry a 1 px stroke
(theme-aware: white on light, near-black on dark) with `paint-order:
stroke fill` so they keep contrast against the map basemap, the
home chip, and any background that happens to share their fill
colour.


## v1.5.0, OpenFreeMap migration, manual PV peak, detail dashboard, multi-country LiDAR

A four-headed iteration on top of v1.4.0. Drops the MapTiler dependency
entirely, replaces auto-calibrating PV with a one-line manual input,
opens a click-through detail dashboard on the home, and rounds out the
LiDAR provider roster started in v1.4.0.

**OpenFreeMap migration.** The map stack moves from MapTiler (paid API
key, opt-in for HACS users) to [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/),
which serves OpenMapTiles-schema vector tiles plus three maintained
styles (Liberty, Positron, Fiord) for free with no key, no signup and
no rate limit. The card now ships with zero credentials to configure;
the basemap and the buildings tile fetch (`helios-buildings.ts`) both
resolve their tile URL once at boot from OpenFreeMap's public
TileJSON. Three knock-on cleanups:

- The `maptiler-key` config option is removed (silently ignored if
  present in old YAML; the engine never reads it).
- The `topo` map style is gone (MapTiler-specific). `map-style` now
  accepts `streets` (Liberty) and `minimal` (Positron).
- A `styleimagemissing` handler stubs unknown sprite refs with a 1 px
  transparent image so OFM's smaller sprite sheet can't spam console
  warnings on style switch.

**Manual PV peak power.** The auto-calibration buffer (a 14-day
rolling fit of `predicted vs actual` samples kept in localStorage and
HA's `frontend/user_data`) is gone. Users now enter the installation's
peak power directly via a new `pv-peak-kwp` numeric option in the
editor. `_pvCalibK()` returns `kwp * 10` when set, `null` otherwise.
When `null`, the dotted forecast line and the predicted-value mode of
the PV chip both hide; the live observation, the PV chip and the
peak-of-day highlight still render. A one-shot boot routine
(`_wipeLegacyPvCalibStorage`, gated by a `helios-pv-calib:wiped-v1`
flag) deletes legacy calibration buckets so the migration is silent
for existing users.

**Detail dashboard.** Clicking the home triggers a camera dive (zoom
+ pitch ease) and fades a chip-styled overlay over the HUD with up
to three sections that appear in sequence (~180 ms stagger between
cards):

- **Today**: produced kWh, projected end-of-day total, peak-of-day
  time. No curve, the timeline above already carries that shape.
- **Tomorrow**: a single chip with weather icon + estimated kWh +
  expected peak hour, derived from the multi-model forecast and the
  Haurwitz / Kasten-Czeplak clear-sky model scaled by `pv-peak-kwp`.
- **Battery**: a vessel showing live SoC and the day's charge /
  discharge totals, present only if at least one battery entity is
  configured.

Each card shares the same chip vocabulary as the on-map overlays
(white surface, 1 px black border, soft shadow), with a dark-theme
override for `card-theme: 'dark'`. Click anywhere outside a card to
exit; the camera eases back to its pre-dive bearing and the HUD
fades back in.

**Hover home glow (replaces always-on halo).** The v1.4.0
sun-coloured halo painted under the home's outline as a permanent
MapLibre `line` layer is replaced by an SVG glow toggled on the
`home_hover` state. The home then reads as a calm anchor at rest and
the focal building only "lights up" when the cursor is over it,
signalling the click affordance for the detail dashboard.

**Multi-country LiDAR roster (continuing v1.4.0).** Four providers
land alongside the existing IGN-FR pipeline: Defra (England,
GeoTIFF DSM minus DTM), IGN España PNOA-LiDAR (peninsular Spain +
Balearics, two MDSn coverages merged via element-wise MAX), PDOK
AHN4 (Netherlands, GeoTIFF DSM minus DTM), Kartverket NHM (Norway +
Svalbard, ArcGIS Float32 GeoTIFF DOM minus DTM). All five route
through the shared post-processing in
`./helios-lidar/helios-lidar-pipeline.ts`. The `geotiff` package
(~120 KB gzip, lazy-loaded codecs inlined by Vite
`inlineDynamicImports`) is the only third-party dependency added.

Probed and parked: Wales (NRW, per-tile ZIP only), Switzerland
(swisstopo, WMS only carries pre-rendered hillshade), Slovakia
(ZBGIS, surface only as PNG), Denmark (Datafordeler DHM, requires
per-user OAuth), United States (federal USGS 3DEP exposes a live
ArcGIS Image Server for bare-earth DEM only; no public DSM service,
and state programmes such as MN DNR publish raw LiDAR as per-tile
ZIP downloads only).

**Timeline polish.** Daily kWh totals now appear under each date
label on the timeline. Sunrise / sunset ring markers on the sun arc
were swapped for MDI icons. The bottom scrub chip is gone; the
clock chip in the top-left flips to the blue scrub theme during a
scrub, and the back-to-live button is fused next to it. Auto-rotate
defaults to `false` (was `true`) so a fresh install is calm by
default; users opt in for kiosk dashboards.

**i18n.** New keys: `todayLabel`, `todayProduced`, `todayForecast`,
`todayPeak`, `tomorrowLabel`, `tomorrowPeak`, `batteryLabel`,
`batteryCharged`, `batteryDischarged`, `pvPeakPower`,
`pvPeakPowerHelp`. Norwegian (`no`) added as the 8th locale.
